                    <p>
                        Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game played from either a third-person or first-person
                        perspective.
                        Players complete missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story.
                        Outside of the missions, players may freely roam the open world.
                        Composed of the San Andreas open countryside area, including the fictional Blaine County, and the
                        fictional city of Los Santos, the world is much larger in area than earlier entries in the series.
                        It may be fully explored after the game's beginning without restriction, although story progress
                        unlocks more gameplay content.

                    <p>
                        Global Offensive, like prior games in the Counter-Strike series, is an objective-based, multiplayer
                        first-person shooter.
                        Two opposing teams, known as the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, compete in game modes to
                        complete objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or guarding
                        hostages.
                        At the end of each round, players are rewarded based on their individual performance with in-game
                        currency to spend on other weapons or utility in subsequent rounds.
                        Winning rounds rewards more money than losing does, and completing objectives such as killing
                        enemies gives cash bonuses.
                        Uncooperative actions, such as killing teammates, results in a penalty.

                        Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large
                        amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.
                        However, there is an achievement system, known as "advancements" in the Java Edition of the game.
                        Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option for third-person
                        perspective.
                        The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called
                        "blocks"—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava.
                        The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects.
                        These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world.
                        Players can "mine" blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things.
                        Many commentators have described the game's physics system as unrealistic; liquids continuously flow
                        for a limited horizontal distance from source blocks, which can be removed by placing a solid block
                        in its place or by scooping it into a bucket.
                        The game also contains a material known as redstone, which can be used to make primitive mechanical
                        devices, electrical circuits, and logic gates, allowing for the construction of many complex
                        systems.

                    <p>
                        Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person shooter game, in which players utilize many
                        different operators from the Rainbow team.
                        Different operators have different nationalities, weapons, and gadgets.
                        The game features an asymmetrical structure whereby the teams are not always balanced in their
                        choices of abilities.
                        The base Counter-Terrorism Units (CTUs) available for play are the American Hostage Rescue Team
                        (referred to in-game as the FBI SWAT), the British SAS, the German GSG-9, the Russian Spetsnaz and
                        the French GIGN, each of which has four operators per unit split between attackers and defenders
                        (other units were later added through downloadable content, see below).

                    <p>
                        The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an action role-playing game with a third-person perspective.
                        Players control Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter known as a Witcher.
                        Geralt walks, runs, rolls and dodges, and (for the first time in the series) jumps, climbs and
                        swims.
                        He has a variety of weapons, including bombs, a crossbow and two swords (one steel and one
                        silver).
                        The steel sword is used primarily to kill humans while the silver sword is more effective
                        against creatures and monsters.
                        Players can draw out, switch and sheathe their swords at will.
                        There are two modes of melee attack; light attacks are fast but weak, and heavy attacks are slow
                        but strong.
                        Players can block and counter enemy attacks with their swords.
                        Swords have limited endurance and require regular repair.
                        In addition to physical attacks, Geralt has five magical signs at his disposal: Aard, Axii,
                        Igni, Yrden and Quen.

                    <p>
                        League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game in the three-dimensional
                        isometric perspective.
                        The game consists of two current running game modes: Summoner's Rift and Howling Abyss.
                        The Crystal Scar and Twisted Treeline, maps corresponding to discontinued game modes, have since
                        been removed.
                        Players compete in matches, lasting anywhere from 20 to 50 minutes on average.
                        In each game mode, teams work together to achieve a victory condition, typically destroying the core
                        building (called the Nexus) in the enemy team's base after bypassing a line of defensive structures
                        called turrets, or towers.
